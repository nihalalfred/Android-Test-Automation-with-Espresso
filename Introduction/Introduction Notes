** Introduction to Android Test Automation with Espresso
--------------------------------------------------------

** What is Espresso?
--------------------

- Espresso is a native testing framework for Android to write reliable UI tests.
- Google released Espresso framework in Oct 2013 and from 2.0 Espresso becomes part of the Android
Support repository.

** Important features of Espresso
---------------------------------

* It automatically synchronises your test actions with the user interface of your application.
* The framework also ensures that your activity is started before the test runs.
* It also lets the test wait until all observed background activities have finished which is
sometimes a problem with other test frameworks.

** We have two types of Android automated UI Tests:
---------------------------------------------------

* UI tests for single apps using Espresso
* UI tests for multiple apps using UI Automator

** For writing test scripts with Espresso we can use Java or Kotlin.
